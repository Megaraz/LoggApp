MockDataInject.sql contains mockdata for the database.
First run update-database to create the database "HealthLoggApp", then run the MockDataInject.sql to populate it with mock data.

The main focus of this project is to build a logg application to log daily data. It's focus is on health and wellness.
The purpose of logging is to track data to see trends and patterns over time, which can help in making informed decisions about health and wellness.
The other main focus is to build a robust project according to OOP, SOLID and a decent Architecture.

Later on the goal is to make it a health/wellness webapplication with user accounts and graphs etc.
